What is the idea? 
We want to investigate the relationship between energy consumption and global warming/mortality
and find a better solution energy wise.

Datasets:
Annual CO2 emissions per country, Environment_Temperature_change_e_all_data,
per-capita-energy-use, share-energy-consum-by-source, world-energy-consumption.

Why is it interesting:
Because they treat a very important topic in today society

Type of genre:
slide show, we believe it would be the most efficacious towards expressing our idea.
Because every image will tell an important piece story, and so slides allow us to focus on
one picture after another. 

Dataset che analizzer√≥: share energy consum by source ha tot righe divise per e per
